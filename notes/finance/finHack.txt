### Automate your finances - Ramit Sethi
* Switch your bills on the first of the month
    * ask credit card, also assume you're paid on the first of the month
* From your paycheck, send a percentage to your 401(k) 
* The rest goes to your checking, with more automated savings
    * Then send money to your Roth IRA
    * Then to your saving's account, and sub savings accounts
* Then, use your checking to pay off your credit card
* Then, pay of misc bills (Rent) -> Can automate! Look up bill pay
* Then standard bills (Amazon, Netflix, Internet, etc.)
* If you do all this, then spend the rest dammit!
* Also, don't forget cash withdraws

* Timing is also important
    * Set up direct deposit!
    * wait a few days before taking money out of your accounts
