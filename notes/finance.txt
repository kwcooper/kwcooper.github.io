###Financial Advisor
* Are they a fiduciary?
    * this means they have your best interest in mind, and must avoid conflicts of interest. This is a recent legal requirement. 
    * They can also be dually registered as both a broker and a fiduciary
        * Run from this
* Are they a [registered financial advisor](https://money.usnews.com/investing/articles/2017-05-17/what-is-a-registered-investment-advisor)?
    * This means they must be registered with the SEC
    * (Post-depression Investment Advisors Act of 1940)
* 1% of assets as payment is typical
    * Be on the lookout for hidden fee’s, however. 
    * Make sure to ask how they are paid.
    * find out about all sources of their compensation by asking for a copy of Form ADV, required by the SEC
    * Miles suggests googling Form ADV Part 2 with the term "investment adviser registration" and the company's name
* You can look them up on [databases](Brokercheck.finra.org) for “background checking”
* Ask the advisor to show you a sample portfolio before you begin
    * Or you can also ask for references of clients
* require an explanation for everything they are trying to do, if you don’t understand be cautious

_Summary_
1. Do background research
2. Ask if they are a registered financial advisor and fiduciary
3. Ask how they get paid and for required docs
4. Ask for references, and planning materials

###Roth IRA
`As an example, if a 20-year-old puts $5,000 a year into a Roth for 10 years and then stops contributing (because they make more than the phase-out amount or need a tax deduction of future contributions to a Traditional retirement account), the 10 years of Roth contributions and growth—let’s say at 8% interest a year to age 65—could total about $1,070,944 of tax-free dollars,” says [Peter J. Creedon](https://www.investopedia.com/advisor-network/advisors/54627/peter-j-creedon-cfp-chfc-clu-/)`

* Retirement account funded by post-tax income
    * future withdrawals that follow Roth IRA regulations are tax free
    * contributions aren't tax- deductible, however.
        * This is the trade off, contribute less now, and gain more later
* Have to be in a medium tax bracket to contribute the maximum amount
    * That is, your modified adjusted gross income is less than $122,000
    * $193,000 if married
* You can contribute only as much as you earned for that year
* Other benefits:
    * You can withdraw your contributions at any time without taxes or penalty (Sort-of, do more research on this)
    * No mandatory withdrawals
    * Saving during retirement: You can continue to contribute
        * I like this because the average retirement age is increasing...
* A Roth IRA can be set up in addition to other retirement accounts
    * Should be used as secondary investment plan to 401k etc.

### Advice from John Oliver Segment on retirement 
* Start saving now 
* Low-Cost Index funds, check yearly
* Ask if your advisor is a fiduciary
* Move from stocks to bonds as you get older
* Keep fee's under one percent


### Charlie Epstein disagrees with John Oliver's advice
* Fiduciary vs Broker (Registered Rep)
    * Depends on who regulated
    * Fiduciary is regulated by Department of Labor, Broker by FINRA
    * Broker has suitability standard
* Argues it's better for fiduciary's to be brokers so they can use more financial tools, such as insurance.

### Questions for your advisor - Dave Ramsey
* Are they a teacher?
* Do they agree with your philosophies?
* Clean code of conduct?
* // not the most rigorous advice...

### Dave Ramsey's investing process:
* "Most advisors make their money off of wealthy people"
* He invests in Growth Stock Mutual Funds, spread across:
    * Growth in income, growth, aggressive growth, and international
    * At least a 10 year track record
* Growth in income (Blue Chip) -> big companies
    * The calmest, stable
* Growth fund (Mid cap) -> growing companies	
    * Performs about as well as the S&P
* Aggressive growth (Small cap) -> small companies
    * Volatile. High high's and low lows
* International (what the name says)
    * Worst performing. Global has the US. 
    * Good to not have all eggs in the US basket
* Index funds mirrors the market, mutual funds that outperform the market
* How to pick mutual funds? Look at the longest track record. Low risk.
* Don't chase returns. Get in and stay in. 
* Millionaires never talk about the fee's

### Casey Smith - [Seeking alpha](https://seekingalpha.com/article/2847756-why-dave-ramsey-is-wrong), Disagrees a bit with Dave
* Says that Dave dismisses a fiduciary and fee-only financial advisor
* "A well-diversified index fund portfolio should cost no more that 0.25% a year, with most of the funds trading at no charge"
