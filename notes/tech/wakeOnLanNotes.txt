# wol with ubuntu 18.04 was a bit tricky. Set up was simple however the problem was that
# for whatever reason, wol was disabled after each boot. 
# 
# I tried to solve this by placing the wol toggle code in the startup file, but it didnt  # exist, so instead I placed it into the bash start up scripts

# command to view if ethernet wol is turned on:
sudo ethtool <internet adaptor; -> enp2s0> 

# look for 'g' not 'd' at the wake-on line

# if 'd', enable it:
sudo ethtool -s enp2s0 wol g

# this is also the line I added to both the .bash_profile for ssh
# as well as the .bashrc for startup. 
# required password on each startup unfortunatly. 

# possibly fixable:
