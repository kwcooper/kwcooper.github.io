### Personal Analytics
Tracking our lives isn't new. One of my favorite people, Ben Franklin, is among the first I know of to [track](http://www.thirteenvirtues.com/) his progress in changing his behavior, though I'm sure many before him had attempted the same.  

After my spring semester of my sophmore year of college I was busy. Between school, research, work, relationships, a slew of personal projects, and attempting to maintain a social life, I needed to get a handle on all of what was occuring. So, I started thinking about ways to really focus on time management. This quickly grew, combined with my data science interests, into personal analytics solutions. 

So here we are. Further inspired by a perfectly aligned productivity week in the lab later that summer, and a couple blog posts, I've started tracking various aspects of my life. I do science on other things, why not on myself?

I then discovered a few thousand people who also had been leveraging data science, new tools, and a wealth of data to record-- and ultimatly improve-- their lives. Quantified Self, is an alias for the personal analytics movement. From time management, I had tranfered my interests into life management, personal development through the lens of sensors and the scientific method. Automation makes this realistic. Moore's law makes it practical.

Apps:
[fitbit]() - use any device they make with their app. Can export data. I started wearing one 12 of '18, and I love it. 
[Gyroscope](https://gyrosco.pe/) - newish app to consolidate various data sources. I havn't tried it yet but would love to at some point
[Nomie](https://nomie.app/) - Simple "Life" tracker. I don't use this, but I may
[selfSpy](https://github.com/selfspy/selfspy) - cmd line unix usage tracking tool (in python 2.6)
[Thyme](https://github.com/sourcegraph/thyme) - another tracking tool (in go). Seems to be well made



Ideas
* There are a lot of blood result checking apps
* This is going to blow up. The large reddit community, support from app usage trackers from Apple and Google, and popularity of fitness trackers lend one to think this will be a huge area. 
    * That said, data is one thing, insights another, and behavior change even more remote. Psychology may remain the biggest barrier.
