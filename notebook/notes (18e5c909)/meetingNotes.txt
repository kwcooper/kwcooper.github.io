### Meeting notes

_Tim Ferris's Format_
He uses this with his girlfriend! They write it down
* Start with what you think you've been doing well/better
* Where do you think you've dropped the ball
* What you are doing well
* Tell the other person what they would "like to see more of"  

_Besos 2 pizza rule for meetings_
No more people in meeting's than 2 pizza's could feed.
