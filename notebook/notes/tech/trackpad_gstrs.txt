I like the touchpad, can get a lot more done when using the mous and not a big change from switching between laptop and desktop. 

There is some support for it on ubuntu, but not the fancy stuff. 

There are a lot of drivers, I tried touchegg, but it crased my ubuntu 18.04...

What worked for me was [fusuma](https://github.com/iberianpig/fusuma) from [this](https://medium.com/@dgviranmalaka/how-to-enhance-touch-pad-gestures-like-mac-in-ubuntu-18-04-laptop-f5f25d5a0b4f) article. 




in brief:

1. add to groups then log out
`sudo gpasswd -a $USER input`

2. now grab some packages 
`sudo apt-get install libinput-tools` and `sudo apt-get install xdotool`

3. fusuma is written in ruby, so grab it if you don't have it (and you don't bc... ruby)
`sudo apt-get install ruby`

4. then get the main event
`sudo gem install fusuma`	

5. Now edit the config file for the trackpad
`cd && cd .config`           # go to user config dir
`mkdir fusuma && cd fusuma/` # create and cd in to fusuma dir
`nano config.yml`            # create config file and edit it

The mapping is below, just paste into the config file:

```
swipe:
  3: 
    left: 
      command: 'xdotool key alt+Shift+Tab'
    right: 
      command: 'xdotool key alt+Tab'
    up: 
      command: 'xdotool key super'
    down: 
      command: 'xdotool key super'
  4:
    left: 
      command: 'xdotool key alt+Left'
    right: 
      command: 'xdotool key alt+Right'
    up: 
      command: 'xdotool key ctrl+alt+Down'
    down: 
      command: 'xdotool key ctrl+alt+Up'
pinch:
  in:
    command: 'xdotool key ctrl+plus'
  out:
     command: 'xdotool key ctrl+minus'

threshold:
  swipe: 0.4
  pinch: 0.4

interval:
  swipe: 0.8
  pinch: 0.1
```

6. exit and run with `sudo fusuma`!

if Ruby throws any issue, try resetting the path with:
`PATH="$PATH:$(ruby -e 'print Gem.user_dir')/bin"`

May want to add to startup applications or a config file if that doesn't work.
