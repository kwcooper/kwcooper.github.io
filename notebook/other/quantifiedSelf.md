Quantified Self / Personal Analytics
=======

About
---------
Tracking our lives isn't new. One of my favorite people, Ben Franklin, is among the first I know of to [track](http://www.thirteenvirtues.com/) his progress in changing his behavior, though I'm sure many before him had attempted the same. 

After my spring semester of my sophomore year of college I was busy. Between school, research, work, relationships, a slew of personal projects, and attempting to maintain a social life, I needed to get a handle on all of what was occurring. So, I started thinking about ways to really focus on time management. This quickly grew, combined with my data science interests, into personal analytics solutions. 

So here we are. Further inspired by a perfectly aligned productivity week in the lab later that summer, and a couple blog posts, I've started tracking various aspects of my life. I do science on other things, why not on myself?

I then discovered a few thousand people who also had been leveraging data science, new tools, and a wealth of data to record-- and ultimately improve-- their lives. Quantified Self, is an alias for the personal analytics movement. From time management, I had transferred my interests into life management, personal development through the lens of sensors and the scientific method. Automation makes this realistic. Moore's law makes it practical.

data is one thing, insights another, and behavior change even more remote. Psychology may remain the biggest barrier.
