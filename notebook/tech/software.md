Software I like
=======


I switch computers a lot, and decided that a list to run through to grab all the software I like would save some time. So without further ado, here is the software that I like. 

Web browsing 
---------
|||
|-|-|
| Chrome | Nuff said. Kills memory, but is the best browser. Grab prioatab or google earth new tab plug-in's |


Most file editing 
---------
|||
|-|-|
| Google Docs | Syncs with most things... Grab the desktop and phone app, and with linux use fuse. |
| Fuse        |    speaking of...  Grab it [here](https://github.com/astrada/google-drive-ocamlfuse) (and docs) |


Programming
---------

|||
|-|-|
| Sublime | Multi platform, minimal, powerful, and free | 
|IDLE | Lightweight and minimal. My custom theme for it is [here](https://github.com/kwcooper/sysConfig/tree/master/idle3_profile). |
| Anaconda | use the conda virtual envirements. |
|terminal editing| team nano | 
|Matlab | MATLAB isn’t all that bad, and there are a few things it does that I like better than python… [MATLAB notes](matlab.md) |
|Brackets | clean and simple program packed with power. I’m a big fan of the UI, as well as the live view option similar to Dreamweaver but without all the MB of clutter. |
|Git and GitHub | Great for keeping everything organized, synced across machines, versioned, and revert-able. [git notes](git.md) |
|R| I've played with it a bit. There seems to be a lot to like and a great community |
|Bash| All my alias's are found [here](https://github.com/kwcooper/sysConfig)|


Science software
---------

|||
|-|-|
| Mendeley | I’m shocked by how many researchers havn’t heard of Mendeley. It’s like google docs but for science, and keeps papers managed by year, author, ect. but also with custom folders. Syncs to my phone, and can pick up on the same paragraph I left off at the lab |  
| plotting? |I’m not sold on good plotting software yet. Actively seeking suggestions. _maybe_ R? MATLAB? Python? Tablu? Simplicity, syntax, and functionality are all |
| Aeskulap | Good software for viewing DICOM images on Unix computers [website](http://aeskulap.nongnu.org/features.html) |


Networking 
---------

|||
|-|-|
| nmap | easily map the network (unix) `sudo apt install nmap` |
| ifconfig | simple network stats (unix) `sudo apt install ifconfig` |
| ethtool | to configure network settings (unix) `sudo apt install ethtool` |
| cyberduck | connect to remote servers via SFTP etc. (OSX) |
| filezilla | same as above, but there isn't a linux cyberduck... (Unix) | 
| Vnstat | Generate historic reports of your network useage, use -l for a 'live' mode. (unix) `sudo apt install vnstat` | 


Jotting 
---------

|||
|-|-|
|Google Keep | All the things from docs apply to keep. However, WHERE IS OUR DAMN API? <>. As I use this more often I am beginning to entertain the idea of using a different application. Android, ios, and anything that runs chrome. |
| Mac stickies | My dream is to integrate these with google keep. I think I may know a way but… |


Video editing
---------

|||
|-|-|
| Oneshot | cross platform, a new semi-standard for my software, open source, and just works. Download on [Ubuntu:](https://www.openshot.org/ppa/) |
