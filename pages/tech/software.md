Software I like
=======


I switch computers a lot, and decided that a list to run through to grab all the software I like would save some time. So without further ado, here is the software that I like. 



Most file editing 
---------
|||
|-|-|
| Google Docs | I like the Google ecosystem, sue me. Having my docs sync on every computer and device I own, is nice. It’s also free, which has a lot going for it. I use this for literally everything. Is there a linux api? No, but this is the few times I’ll make do. Besides I found a nice workaround with fuse. |
| Fuse        |    speaking of...  Grab it [here](https://github.com/astrada/google-drive-ocamlfuse) (and docs) |


Programming
---------

|||
|-|-|
|Python IDLE, Sublime, Anaconda Spyder|For the most part I stick with IDLE. My custom theme for it is [here](https://github.com/kwcooper/sysConfig/tree/master/idle3_profile). I’ve used I've used sublime off and on for a few years. After switching back to a linux desktop, I didn’t like a few things about IDLE on linux (at least Ubuntu 18.04), so I use the terminal/sublime combo. This is a lot better after learning the python interactive session [trick](python.md) I’ll use Anaconda occasionally. |
|terminal editing| team nano | 
|Matlab|I hope some researchers make the switch to open source eventually, but as long as the University foots the bill for the license, MATLAB isn’t all that bad, and there are a few things it does that I like better than python… gasp [MATLAB notes](matlab.md) |
|Brackets | clean and simple program packed with power. I’m a big fan of the UI, as well as the live view option similar to Dreamweaver but without all the MB of clutter. |
|Git and GitHub | Great for keeping everything organized, synced across machines, versioned, and revert-able. [git notes](git.md) |
|R| I've played with it a bit. There seems to be a lot to like and a great community |
|Bash| All my alias's are found [here](https://github.com/kwcooper/sysConfig)|


Science software
---------

|||
|-|-|
| Mendeley | I’m shocked by how many researchers havn’t heard of Mendeley. It’s like google docs but for science, and keeps papers managed by year, author, ect. but also with custom folders. Syncs to my phone, and can pick up on the same paragraph I left off at the lab |  
| plotting? |I’m not sold on good plotting software yet. Actively seeking suggestions. _maybe_ R? MATLAB? Python? Tablu? Simplicity, syntax, and functionality are all |
| Aeskulap | Good software for viewing DICOM images on Unix computers [website](http://aeskulap.nongnu.org/features.html) |


Networking 
---------

|||
|-|-|
| nmap | easily map the network (unix) `sudo apt install nmap` |
| ifconfig | simple network stats (unix) `sudo apt install ifconfig` |
| ethtool | to configure network settings (unix) `sudo apt install ethtool` |
| cyberduck | connect to remote servers via SFTP etc. (OSX) |
| filezilla | same as above, but there isn't a linux cyberduck... (Unix) | 
| Vnstat | Generate historic reports of your network useage, use -l for a 'live' mode. (unix) `sudo apt install vnstat` | 


Jotting 
---------

|||
|-|-|
|Google Keep | All the things from docs apply to keep. However, WHERE IS OUR DAMN API? <>. As I use this more often I am beginning to entertain the idea of using a different application. Android, ios, and anything that runs chrome. |
| Mac stickies | My dream is to integrate these with google keep. I think I may know a way but… |


Video editing
---------

|||
|-|-|
| Oneshot | cross platform, a new semi-standard for my software, open source, and just works. Download on [Ubuntu:](https://www.openshot.org/ppa/) |


Audio editing
---------


Social Media 
---------
|||
|-|-|
| [friend remover Free](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/friend-remover-free-delet/pjpnfokdiejfmghfaejjcfnilfgaoogd) | So useful to help manage facebook friends (Chrome) |
| [Social Book](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/social-book-post-manager/ljfidlkcmdmmibngdfikhffffdmphjae)| Automate deleting old posts and likes, and pages etc (Chrome)|

File management 
---------
|||
|-|-|
| Hardinfo | displays system information in detail (linix) `sudo apt install hardinfo` |

MISC 
---------
|||
|-|-|
| Caffine | super useful app that prevents sleep (OSX, unix)
