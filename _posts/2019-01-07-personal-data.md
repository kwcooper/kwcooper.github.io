I’m still figuring out where I land on the open personal data online debate. It’s probably not completely safe yet, but also probably not as bad as everyone things. In any case, I thought it best to purge some of my closely identifiable information from various repo’s. This is a running list of those sites. It may be a good yearly habit to run through the sites and check what info is published. 


These were recomended from brand yourself:


WhitePages
Intelius
InstantCheckmate
TruthFinder
Acxiom

(Acxiom’s opt out form was a bit harder to [find](https://isapps.acxiom.com/optout/)optout.aspx

So far, I opted out of Intel, Instant checkmate, and Acxiom, will have to wait a few weeks to assess the results. My info wasn’t on TruthFinder. 

From a lifework [article](https://www.lifewire.com/remove-personal-information-from-internet-3482691) I pulled a few more. 

Radaris
USA People Search
PrivateEye.com & PublicRecordsNOW
ZabaSearch
PeekYou
BeenVerified
AnyWho

Zabasearch was annoying, and required a fax of your ID, my info wasn’t on any of the other sites.
