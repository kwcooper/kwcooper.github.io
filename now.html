                    <p><i> Sonder: n. (neologism) The profound feeling of realizing that everyone, including strangers passed in the street, has a life as complex as one's own, 
                    which they are constantly living despite one's personal lack of awareness of it. </i> </p>
					
                    <p>For what it’s worth, sonder isn’t necessarily a real word (if you measure your word validity by their existence in the standard dictionary), though google it if you find the time. Nevertheless, I think it is a nice reminder to think about one’s place amongst the other seven billion people carrying out their lives (what the counter is estimating above). I would rather someone take away and meditate on that sense of complexity and scale than any specifics about myself. Though ironically, maybe that does tell you something about me. </p>

                    <p>But if you must know, here’s what I’m working on now: Currently, most of my time is dedicated to conducting scientific <a href=”research.html”><font color="white"><u>research</u></font></a>, primarily on brain systems underlying learning and memory. Starting work at a new university means I’m quite busy getting to know the lay of the land. Working with a couple of labs, this includes brain electrophysiology and writing new analysis to help understand the data we collect. This also ties into my interests in artificial intelligence, and I’m working on growing <a href="https://www.continualai.org/"> <font color="white"> <u>ContinualAI</u></font></a>, a research non-profit dedicated to building intelligent machines that learn like we do. </p>
                    
                    <p> More personally, I’m also excited by the quantified self movement and using data driven approaches to improve my lifestyle and productivity. I recently built a slew of home networking tools, and a dedicated server to help manage my digital life and to automate a handful of tasks. I’ve recently also built an online wiki, and will roll that out soon. My recent departure from ADAPT consulting has me exploring new consulting opportunities, and I’m looking to pick back up on my web design hobby. </p>
                    
                    <p>When I'm not caught up in all of that, you can find me snowboarding, running, tending to my plants, working through the <a href="https://www.accesstoinsight.org/"> <font color="white"> <u>Tripitaka</u></font></a>, maintaining a social life, tackling random datasets with for loops, and a new finding that the locals call “brunch” | 191021</p>
                    
                    <p> My academic friends may also want to see my CV <a href="https://github.com/kwcooper/curriculumVitae/blob/master/cooperCV.pdf" target="_blank"><font color="white"><u>here</u></font></a></p>
