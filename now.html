Nevertheless, I think it is a nice reminder to think about one’s place amongst the other seven billion people carrying out their lives (what the counter is estimating above). I would rather someone take away and meditate on that sense of complexity and scale than any specifics about myself. "

          <p> At some point in time, I had become aware of one the most beautiful words: </p>
        
          <br>
        
          <quote> <b>Sonder: n. (neologism) </b> The profound feeling of realizing that everyone, including strangers passed in the street, has a life as complex as one's own, which they are constantly living despite one's personal lack of awareness of it. </quote>

          <p>For what it’s worth, if you measure a word's validity by its existence in the standard dictionary, <i>sonder</i> isn’t necessarily a "real" word. Rather, it was <a href="https://www.dictionaryofobscuresorrows.com/post/23536922667/sonder" target="_blank">invented</a> by one of the strangers it refers to. </p>

          <p>Nevertheless, I find it is a brilliant reminder of one’s place amongst the other seven billion and some people carrying out their lives on this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wupToqz1e2g" target="_blank">pale blue dot</a>. That's what the counter is estimating above. I would rather someone take away and meditate on that sense of complexity and scale first, than any specifics about myself: just another one of them; of us.</p>

          <p>Currently, most of my time is dedicated to conducting scientific <a href=research.html><u>research</u></a>, primarily on the dynamics and brain systems underlying learning and memory, with Fortin lab and our collaborators. This research also ties into my interests in artificial intelligence, and I’m working on growing <a href="https://www.continualai.org/" target="_blank"> <u>ContinualAI</u></a>, a research non-profit dedicated to building intelligent machines that learn more like we do. </p>
          
          <p> In addition, the global pandemic has changed much of our daily lives. I've volenteered part of my time towards COVID-19 research, with the aim to understand its strongest neurological symptom: loss of taste and smell</p>

          <p> More personally, I’m also excited by the quantified self movement and using data driven approaches to improve my lifestyle and productivity. I recently built a slew of home networking tools, and a dedicated server to help manage my digital life and to automate a handful of tasks. I’ve recently also built an online wiki, and will roll that out soon. My recent departure from ADAPT consulting has me exploring new consulting opportunities, and I’m looking to pick back up on my web design hobby. </p>

          <p>When I'm not caught up in all of that, you can find me snowboarding, running, tending to my plants, working through the <a href="https://www.accesstoinsight.org/" target="_blank"> <u>Tripitaka</u></a>, maintaining a social life, tackling random datasets with for loops, and a new finding that the locals call “brunch” | 191021</p>

          <p> My academic friends may also want to see my CV <a href="https://github.com/kwcooper/curriculumVitae/blob/master/cooperCV.pdf" target="_blank"><u>here</u></a></p>
