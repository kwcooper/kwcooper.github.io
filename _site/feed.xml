&lt;p&gt;Black Lines wants it to be as easy to serve a Negroni as it is a pint of lager. The drinks company is seeking to revolutionise the bar experience by serving cocktails by draught with a changing menu of drinks (as well as same favourite stand-bys). A pink grapefruit spritz was served through the summer while a new pear and white tea fizz joins the line-up for winter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;ROFL means Rolling on floor laughing.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;STFU means Shut the &lt;em&gt;freak&lt;/em&gt; up.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;LMK means Let me know.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;ILY means I love you.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;YOLO means You only live once.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;SMH means Shaking my head.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The company was previously known as Hingston + Co. but has been given a complete rebrand — including a new logo, tap badges, website and branded material — by London-based design studio &amp;amp; Smith. The new identity is based on the Kandinsky abstract painting, Black Lines, and true to its name, is mostly black and white with a few flashes of colour. According to &amp;amp; Smith, the identity brings together “art and science” and has been brought to life through collaborations with nine illustrators.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The watch has the following features:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Time and date displayed on the screen. Current time is in large numbers, date is in small numbers above it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Light: Pressing the light button on the side of the watch activates a light while the button is pressed. Pressing and holding that button for 3 seconds turns on the light and keeps it on, until the button is held again for 3 seconds or up to 2 hours. After 2 hours, it will automatically turn off.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alarm. A daily alarm may be set for a given time. The alarm may be enabled or disabled. When the alarm is enabled and the alarm time is reached, the watch will beep fast for 5 seconds, then slowly for 30 seconds, then fast for another 5 seconds. Pressing any button stops the alarm sound (in addition to performing its normal function).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Timer. Timer mode shows a count-up timer that starts at 00:00. When the timer is started, it counts up. Pressing the start/stop button will pause the timer, pressing it again continues counting up. Pressing and holding the button for 3 seconds resets the timer to 00:00 and stops counting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mystery answer. After entering this mode, the screen initially displays “ask now”. The user may ask a yes-or-no question aloud and press the start/stop button, this will display a randomly selected answer that is one of the following: “yeah”, “yeah right”, “no”, “no doubt”, “keep trying”, “keep dreaming”. Whenever the display has more than one word, only one word is displayed for 2 seconds, then the other word is displayed for 2 seconds, alternately. The answer is displayed until the user leaves this mode, or he/she presses start/stop again for a new answer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note: these strings are for the English version of the watch, we will need to use completely different strings in other countries without reprogramming the logic of the watch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The watch has the following features:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Time and date displayed on the screen. Current time is in large numbers, date is in small numbers above it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Light: Pressing the light button on the side of the watch activates a light while the button is pressed. Pressing and holding that button for 3 seconds turns on the light and keeps it on, until the button is held again for 3 seconds or up to 2 hours. After 2 hours, it will automatically turn off.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alarm. A daily alarm may be set for a given time. The alarm may be enabled or disabled. When the alarm is enabled and the alarm time is reached, the watch will beep fast for 5 seconds, then slowly for 30 seconds, then fast for another 5 seconds. Pressing any button stops the alarm sound (in addition to performing its normal function).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Timer. Timer mode shows a count-up timer that starts at 00:00. When the timer is started, it counts up. Pressing the start/stop button will pause the timer, pressing it again continues counting up. Pressing and holding the button for 3 seconds resets the timer to 00:00 and stops counting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mystery answer. After entering this mode, the screen initially displays “ask now”. The user may ask a yes-or-no question aloud and press the start/stop button, this will display a randomly selected answer that is one of the following: “yeah”, “yeah right”, “no”, “no doubt”, “keep trying”, “keep dreaming”. Whenever the display has more than one word, only one word is displayed for 2 seconds, then the other word is displayed for 2 seconds, alternately. The answer is displayed until the user leaves this mode, or he/she presses start/stop again for a new answer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note: these strings are for the English version of the watch, we will need to use completely different strings in other countries without reprogramming the logic of the watch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Black Lines wants it to be as easy to serve a Negroni as it is a pint of lager. The drinks company is seeking to revolutionise the bar experience by serving cocktails by draught with a changing menu of drinks (as well as same favourite stand-bys). A pink grapefruit spritz was served through the summer while a new pear and white tea fizz joins the line-up for winter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;ROFL means Rolling on floor laughing.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;STFU means Shut the &lt;em&gt;freak&lt;/em&gt; up.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;LMK means Let me know.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;ILY means I love you.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;YOLO means You only live once.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;SMH means Shaking my head.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The company was previously known as Hingston + Co. but has been given a complete rebrand — including a new logo, tap badges, website and branded material — by London-based design studio &amp;amp; Smith. The new identity is based on the Kandinsky abstract painting, Black Lines, and true to its name, is mostly black and white with a few flashes of colour. According to &amp;amp; Smith, the identity brings together “art and science” and has been brought to life through collaborations with nine illustrators.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;“The public is more familiar with bad design than good design. It is, in effect, conditioned to prefer bad design, because that is what it lives with. The new becomes threatening, the old reassuring.”&lt;/p&gt;
