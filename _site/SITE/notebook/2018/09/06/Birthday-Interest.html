<h3 id="back-story">Back story</h3>
<p>Youâ€™re asked what you want for your birthday. You could say an iPhone or a new pair of socks, but you care about your money so instead you ask for something a bit less tangible. What if you could have 1%. That is, what if you could have one percent added to your interest every year on your birthday. How much money would you have?</p>

<p>We thought of this while on break at work, a co-worker and I were talking about interest, and somehow it was brought up about what you happen if the interest was your age. I thought this would be interesting to see, so I coded it up.</p>

You can see that it is an exellent case of an exponental function</p>
