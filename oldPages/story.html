<p> When the publishing company sent me a university level book on the human body rather than the typical, age appropriate ones on space and cosmos that my parents would order, my plans for the future began to change.
Granted, I was about 8, but up until that point I practically had my application submitted to NASA. I didn’t drop space completely, but it was a gradual change as I found myself spending 
an increased amount of time reading the human anatomy and physiology book -er, looking at the pictures. But as I did read more and more,
one section would captivate me more than any other, the nervous system. </p>


<p> As it should, though I might not have known it at first, the nervous system, and more specifically the brain, holds the essence of everything that makes us, well, us. More simply put, you are 
what your brain does. Every thought, feeling, memory, hope, dream, fear, creation, speech, song, or joke; everything that makes you alive and everything that makes you human, is a direct result of some neural 
computation. Every day we’re learning more and more about the puzzles of the universe's most complex creation; every day we’re learning more about ourselves.</p>


<p>Growing up in the internet age, at least for me, gave me the opportunity to explore all of the great things people were doing, not only in neuroscience, but everything. Youtube and open 
courseware would fill the gaps of what I didn’t see in High-school, especially technology, a growing passion at that time. The legos of my childhood were replaced by circuit boards, rebuilt from 
throwaway desktops from family members or garage sales. And when on national television, Jan Scheuermann, a lifetime quadriplegic, drank from a cup controled by a robotic arm interfaced with her brain, 
the gap between neuroscience and technology had been filled. </p>

<p> After studying brain, minds, and technology for a period of time, not only do you think of neural interfaces, but also digital minds, more aptly known as artificial intelligences or synthetic intelligences.
As I was transitioning from middle school, the AI winter was thawing out, fueled by the heat of each breakthrough that I observed through the the window of my computer. 
Moreover, AI is a wonderful way to test your progress on understanding the mind, and learn what we once thought was difficult isn’t as hard as we think, such as chess; and what we once thought was easy is hard, such as pouring water into a cup. 
Every field that has benefited from computers is benefiting from this weak AI, and this is truly only the beginning of all that is possible.</p>


<p> Somehow, along the way, I developed interests in other areas as well. My passion for education -policy and reform- seemingly emerging from my own experiences, and fueled by Ted talks, 
articles, statistics, and other like minded individuals on the matter. My study of the brain and mind lead me to philosophy of mind, which in turn lead me to begin the study philosophy as a whole. And 
with the first time I could vote being the 2016 election controversy, politics have also increasingly began to grow as an importance in my life.</p>


<p> I have ideas of what I want to accomplish, but through everything I do, the overarching theme is simple: improve life for as many people as possible, constantly discover what it means to be 
human, and explore the mysteries of the cosmos that surrounds and embodies us all. </p>
