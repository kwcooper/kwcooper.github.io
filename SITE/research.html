                <p> At the most fundamental level, I am drawn to understanding the complex systems around us. Nothing stands in isolation. Whether it be congressional voting patterns, an animal foraging for food, the ebbs and flows of the stock market, or the communication between brain regions, like most scientists, I wish to define the key parts of systems, the underpinnings of their dynamism, and the outcomes of their interactions. </p>
                <p>I’m chiefly concerned with a system which may be the most complex, yet personal of the lot: the brain. Sitting on your shoulders is not only what allows you to even read and comprehend this paragraph, but also defines ‘you’ in the first place. From your favorite song, the fact you like ketchup but not tomatoes, or your fear of spiders, to your hopes, dreams, and aspirations, all of what you consider to be you are defined within the patterns of electrical activity of billions of cells. </p>
                <p> The brain is what has allowed humanity's greatest achievements: curing diseases, putting a man on the moon, and, dare I say, the internet, to name only a few. Moreover, it is the brain that allows us to even understand and build these complex systems in the first place. Yet, importantly, our abilities to do all of this doesn’t exist at birth, but rather are learned over days, years, and lifetimes. </p>
                <p><b>My research aims to understand the systems of the brain that allow this lifelong, continual learning and remembrance to occur. </b></p>
