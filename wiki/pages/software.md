Software I like
=======


I switch computers a lot, and decided that a list to run through to grab all the software I like would save some time. So without further ado, here is the software that I like. 



Most file editing 
---------

Google Docs
I like the Google ecosystem, sue me. Having my docs sync on every computer and device I own, is nice. It’s also free, which has a lot going for it. I use this for literally everything. Is there a linux api? No, but this is the few times I’ll make do. Besides I found a nice workaround with fuse.

Programming
---------

###Python: IDLE, Sublime, Anaconda Spyder
I try out a lot, for the most part I stick with IDLE, mainly because it can run straight to the interpreter without having to switch to the command prompt, as well the clean interface. 
My custom IDLE theme [here](https://github.com/kwcooper/sysConfig/tree/master/idle3_profile)

I’ve used sublime off and on for a few years, and after switching back to a linux desktop, I didn’t like a few things about IDLE on linux (at least Ubuntu 18.04), so I use the terminal/sublime combo. This is a lot better after learning the python interactive session [trick](python.md)

I’ll use Anaconda occasionally, mostly if I need to take advantage of viewing the variables. 

terminal editing: team nano, sue me again. 


###Matlab
I use what my PI uses (as well as most of science), so my hands are tied. While I hope some researchers make the switch to open source eventually, as long as the University foots the bill for the license, MATLAB isn’t all that bad, and there are a few things it does that I like better than python… gasp

###Brackets
Another clean and simple program packed with power. I’m a big fan of the UI, as well as the live view option similar to Dreamweaver but without all the MB of clutter.

###Git and GitHub
Great for keeping everything organized, synced across machines, versioned, and revert-able. 


Science 
---------

###Mendeley
I’m shocked by how many researchers havn’t heard of Mendeley. It’s like google docs but for science, and keeps everything managed by year, author, ect. but also with custom folders. Syncs to my phone, and can pick up on the same paragraph I left off at the lab.  


I’m not sold on good plotting software yet. Actively seeking suggestions. 


Jotting 
---------
###Google Keep
All the things from docs apply to keep. However, WHERE IS OUR DAMN API? <>. As I use this more often I am beginning to entertain the idea of using a different application. Android, ios, and anything that runs chrome.

look at my bash profile here <>


Mac stickies. 
My dream is to integrate these with google keep. I think I may know a way but…


Video editing
---------

###Oneshot
it’s cross platform, a new semi-standard for my software, open source, and just works. 
Download on [Ubuntu:](https://www.openshot.org/ppa/)
