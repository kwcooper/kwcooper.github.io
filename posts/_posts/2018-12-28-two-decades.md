When I turned twenty I posted a bit of my thoughts onto Facebook. This is a repost of [those](https://www.facebook.com/K.Wade.Cooper/posts/10207583880186108) thoughts:

*Yesterday I turned 20, and it made me reflect on many things. I have lived through the first fifth of my life, and I have grown up, from a tabula rasa to budding adult. I have learned to walk, talk, play, write, sing, build, code, dream, and -more importantly than everything else- relearned how to question the world around me as I had as a child. A child that was one of the lucky ones, being brought up in a great town by a great family, of which without I wouldn't be alive, let alone where I am today. This cannot be understated: You come to realize how little what you know and do is really your own, but rather the culmination of your parents, family, friends, co-workers, and even those from the past. Whether it's feeding yourself or thinking on your own, the ability seems in from those around you. It's our greatest gift, and should be emphasized at every turn, and headed, as there is a fine line between the pro's and con's of dogma. I learn from these examples, and try and take the advice that is shown or given. If college has taught me nothing it's this, that the world is a big place with a lot of people (seriously a lot and even more when you count all the ones who are no longer have life) and each one has their own take on the world; their own life as complex as your own. I view these first 20 years as the years of learning, and this learning is not quantifiable; it is vast, and shaping, so shaping it has manipulated the direction I plan (and emphasis on plan) to lead my life. We forget sometimes that at one point we were children, and the ignorance of the world and how to live in it was freeing. I think we cared so much about what people thought of us in school because we really didn't have much else to care about, among other things, (mostly because we are human etc.). That ignorance led to the learning that we all, without fail embarked upon, by design, and school is the last thing I'm talking about here. We learned about people and places, and things, and how to drive, and how to have friendships, it goes on and on. We learned all of this, because we didn't know them, and maybe more importantly because we knew that we didn't. It's funny how as soon as we cease this, how as soon as we get comfortable in what we think we know, that our interpretation, our ease, and our outlook on life all begin to crumble. The advice of those three times my age tell me that these two decades are the best years of my life, and I hope without bounds that I prove them wrong, not because these first twenty were bad, but because they were quite good. I hope I never lose the lust for life that had when I was that child, and I'm curious and excited to what the next twenty will bring. I'm curious what advice and knowledge and entertainment I can add to the melting pot, and many, many thanks to all who have graced my life with their own, may it never cease.*
